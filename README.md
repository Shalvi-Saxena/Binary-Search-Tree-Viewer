CS-With-Android Project Binary Search Tree Viewer
============================


**This repository contains code for module BST Viewer Game of Google's Computer Science with Android.**
[*BST Viewer CSwithAndroid*](https://cswithandroid.withgoogle.com/unit?unit=17&lesson=19)


The mechanics of the game are as follows:
------------------------------------------------------------
* This application is a  visualization of a binary search tree that contains the values 1 through 20. The order in which the values are inserted will be randomized causing the tree to take on a shape unique to that input sequence. The user is then challenged to guess the location of any given node within the tree.
*It will prompt the user to click on each node in a random order. The nodes that the user identifies correctly will be displayed in green. The nodes that the user clicks on incorrectly will be displayed in red and the node they should have clicked on will be displayed in cyan.

Data Structures used in code:
